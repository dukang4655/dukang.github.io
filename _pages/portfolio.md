Project 1: An investigation on Wavelet Transform and Compressed Sensing
======
This [－>SLIDE<-](http://dukang4655.github.io/files/WT&CS.pdf) is a summary of my first month intership at Philips Healthcare, which investigated certain amount of papers and tutorials on wavelet transform and compressed sensing. (This PDF version does not include citation informations. Please do NOT spread it. I will remove it from this site soon!)

Project 2: Developing GUI software for visualizing 3D motion of coronary arteries
======
This project is a collaboration between SIPL and Shandong Cancer Hospital on planning image guided radiation therapy (IGRT) for treatment of pulmonary tumor. If you're intereted in this project, please read this [->REVIEW<-](http://dukang4655.github.io/files/review.pdf) on the characterion of 3D motion of coronary arteries.

Project 3: An automatic algorithm for 3D vascular structure segmentation based on Graph Guts
======
Proposed algorithm performed the segmentation of coronary artery and Pulmonary vessels automatically by Labeling non-vascular structure and remove them to keep vascular structures. (This work will soon be submitted, so the details of the method is not availabe now.)

This following pictures are the segmentation result for coronary artery 3D CT data.

The segmentation result for left coronary artery (data, label, result):
