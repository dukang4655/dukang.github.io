*Project 1: An investigation on Wavelet Transform and Compressed Sensing*

This [SLIDE](http://dukang4655.github.io/files/WT&CS.pdf) is a summary of my first month intership at Philips Healthcare, which investigated certain amount of papers and tutorials on wavelet transform and compressed sensing. (This PDF version does not include citation informations. Please do NOT spread it. I will remove it from this site soon!)

*Project 2: Developing GUI software for visualizing 3D motion of coronary arteries*

This project is a collaboration between SIPL and Shandong Cancer Hospital on planning image guided radiation therapy (IGRT) for treatment of pulmonary tumor. If you're intereted in this project, please read this [REVIEW](http://dukang4655.github.io/files/review.pdf) on the characterion of 3D motion of coronary arteries.

*Project 3: An automatic algorithm for 3D vascular structure segmentation based on Graph Guts*

Proposed algorithm performed the segmentation of coronary artery and Pulmonary vessels automatically by labeling non-vascular structure and remove them to keep vascular structures (This work will soon be submitted, so the details of the method is not availabe now). The following pictures are 2 slices of the segmentation results for coronary artery 3D CT data.

The segmentation result for left coronary artery (data, label, result):

The segmentation result for right coronary artery (data, label, result):

*Project 4: An interactive algorithm for 3D+t vascular structure segmentation based on Minimal Path Method*

3D+t vascular structure motion tracking or segmentation is still an impractical work from my opinion, due to poor time continuity of the 3D data (our data is 20+ frames in a cardiac cycle). I designed an interactive algorithm to reduce human interactoin of Minimal Path based vessel centerline extraction method. I wrote a paper form [report](http://dukang4655.github.io/files/4d_VesselSeg.pdf) for my proposed method.
