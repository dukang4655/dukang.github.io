Project 1: Investigation on Wavelet Transform and Compressed Sensing
======
This [slide](http://dukang4655.github.io/files/WT&CS.pdf) is a summary of my first month intership at Philips Healthcare, which investigated certain amount of papers and tutorials on wavelet transform and compressed sensing. (This PDF version does not include citation informations. Please do NOT spread it. I will remove it from this site soon!)

Project 2: Deceloping GUI software for visualizing 3D motion of coronary arteries
======
This project is a collaboration between SIPL and Shandong Cancer Hospital on planning image guided radiation therapy（IGRT） for Pulmonary tumor. If you're intereted in this project, I wrote a [review](http://dukang4655.github.io/files/review.pdf) on characterion of 3D motion of coronary arteries.
